      <div class="description">
        Hello there! I'm Chester (in case you missed it). I'm a UX designer from Hong Kong and a graduate from PolyU Design.
        <span class="paragraphbreak"></span>
        I see design not only as a tool for solving problems, but also an opportunity to bring new perspectives. From practical utility apps to casual games, my work focuses on delivering an engaging and meaningful experience in a simplistic yet effective package. I've shown my capability of performing in every stage of the user-centered design process and supporting my team, including but not limited to, researching, analyzing, developing, testing and iterating.
        <span class="paragraphbreak"></span>
        Outside of work, I play games, watch live streams, tinker with electronics, and follow tech news. Basically a big nerd.

            A gamified self-reflection tool which facilitates practicing reflection as a daily routine. It offers a guided self-reflective learning experience by recording their thoughts, behaviours and associated character strengths, which ultimately improves their psychological wellness and enables self-growth. This capstone project is awarded Tutors’ Choice at PolyU Design Annual Show 2019.

              The CSV framework provides a scientific classification and measure for the positive strengths or traits in human beings. It identifies 24 measurable character strengths and organizes them into 6 classes of virtue. Every individual possesses all of the character strengths but in different degrees.

              Three major issues are found for the common practice of self-reflection in our background research.
              <span class="paragraphbreak"></span>
              Most of our target audience reflect on themselves, but no further action is taken since the process is not documented. Second, self-reflection without feedback lacks the perspective for an all-around thinking and learning experience. Third, The lack of indicators for measuring improvement makes self-reflection a frustrating learning process.

              The goal of the first workshop is to understand users’ behaviour on practicing reflection and their motivation. Seven participants are invited to share daily routines and personal values through activies like journey mapping and card sorting.
              <span class="paragraphbreak"></span>
              We discover that our participants wanted to better utilize their wasted time, especially while commuting. They also share that personal development is their most reviewed topic.

              The second workshop aims to understand users’ quality of reflection and their opinion on feedback. We host a 3-day 36-hour self-reflection simulation via WhatsApp with four participants. They are invited to private groups with facilitators acting as their personal feedback provider. They are encouraged to share their thoughts anytime and rate the feedback.
              <span class="paragraphbreak"></span>
              The chat records and their opinion from the post-simulation discussion are collected and organized as transcript for further analysis. Our participants are generally positive on our feedback and advice, and generally agreed that they reflect more deeply. We conclude that having emotional support is as important as having constructive advice.

              We invite seven participants and learn about their learning process and engagement while playtesting the Refles prototype. Participants play though the introduction and tutorial sessions of Refles and later fill in the questionnaire on their understanding of our prototype.
              <span class="paragraphbreak"></span>
              The result is mostly positive. The majority of our participants are willing to try using Refles in their daily routine and develop their habit of self-reflecting.

              Since our team was constrained by the limited production duration, we were seeking a development tool which handles rapid prototyping and the production of the official release. After briefly researching different viable methods, we adopted Construct 2 as our development platform for its ease of use and various publishing options.

              As part of our tasks for pre-production, it's critical to ensure that its technical capability is able to suit our needs. A feasibility prototype was built for testing supported features and performance on mainstream mobile browsers. Understanding its technical constraints helps us in the ideation process.

            <div class="description">
              Once we're confident that our project is technically viable, we shifted our focus on designing levels and mechanics. We started by picking the key activities from the list of beekeeping work, which introduces fundamental knowledge and fun facts that are unique to Hong Kong recreational beekeeping.
              <span class="paragraphbreak"></span>
              For example, most of the beekeepers we visited shared their experience in building their own apiaries. Therefore the core concept of the first level carried on since the early development, except for some adjustments to the interaction.
              <span class="paragraphbreak"></span>
              On the other hand, some drafts went through several major iterations. The goal of the second level is to introduce how beekeepers obtain their bees, and we had a few iterations prototyped for internal testing and review, but they were remarked as either dull or too idealistic. Thanks to these timely reviews and our rapid prototyping cycle, we were able to quickly generate new ideas and refine them, which successfully turned into an entertaining minigame.

            <div class="description">
              While the prototyping was in progress, our graphic designers were constantly providing updated assets for the game. They maintained the quality of our visual identity across all of our deliverables, and they were actively revising in-game graphics in every iteration of the prototype. By working with them in close synergy, we were able to express our ideas and build what we had envisioned together.

            <div class="description">
              It's common for locals to build and repair apiaries with resources around them. Apiaries are generally made out of fir while making out of pine would cause discomfort for the bees. It's crucial when starting beekeeping for the first time.

            <div class="description">
              Although bees can be obtained through retailers, local hobbyists prefer to catch bees in the wild. There are many ways to capture a beehive but they all require beekeepers to have good eyesight to spot one. The success rate increases with more experience and practice.

            <div class="description">
              Wasps are one of the biggest threat to bee colonies. If a single wasp is able to infiltrate an apiary, an entire colony could be wiped out. That's why beekeepers have a duty to actively search and eliminate any threat to the bees. Using a fly swatter is a bit primitive yet very effective.

            <div class="description">
              Hard work pays off in this stage for our beekeepers. Honey can be extracted from the honeycomb formed within the frame by utilizing centrifugal force. Spinning it rapidly maximizes the yield, but beware that it may also harm the eggs inside the comb.
