      <div class="description">
        Hello there! I'm Chester (in case you missed it).
        I'm a UX designer from Hong Kong and a graduate from PolyU Design.
        <span class="paragraphbreak"></span>
        I see design not only as a tool for solving problems, but also an opportunity to bring new perspectives.
        From practical utility apps to casual games, my work focuses on delivering an engaging and meaningful experience in a simplistic yet effective package.
        I've shown my capability of performing in every stage of the user-centered design process and supporting my team, including but not limited to, researching, analyzing, developing, testing and iterating.
        <span class="paragraphbreak"></span>
        Outside of work, I play games, watch live streams, tinker with electronics, and follow tech news.
        Basically a big nerd.

            A gamified self-reflection tool which facilitates practicing reflection as a daily routine.
            It offers a guided self-reflective learning experience by recording their thoughts, behaviours and associated character strengths, which ultimately improves their psychological wellness and enables self-growth.

              Refles is based on the scientifically proven studies of the Character Strengths and Virtues (CSV) framework.
              <span class="paragraphbreak"></span>
              The CSV framework provides a scientific classification and measure for the positive strengths or traits in human beings.
              It identifies 24 measurable character strengths and organizes them into 6 classes of virtue.
              Every individual possesses all of the character strengths but in different degrees.

              Three major issues are found for the common practice of self-reflection in our background research.
              <span class="paragraphbreak"></span>
              Most of our target audience reflect on themselves, but no further action is taken since the process is not documented.
              Second, self-reflection without feedback lacks the perspective for an all-around thinking and learning experience.
              Third, The lack of indicators for measuring improvement makes self-reflection a frustrating learning process.

              The goal of the first workshop is to understand users’ behaviour on practicing reflection and their motivation.
              Seven participants are invited to share daily routines and personal values through activies like journey mapping and card sorting.
              <span class="paragraphbreak"></span>
              We discover that our participants wanted to better utilize their wasted time, especially while commuting.
              They also share that personal development is their most reviewed topic.

              The second workshop aims to understand users’ quality of reflection and their opinion on feedback.
              We host a 3-day 36-hour self-reflection simulation via WhatsApp with four participants.
              They are invited to private groups with facilitators acting as their personal feedback provider.
              They are encouraged to share their thoughts anytime and rate the feedback.
              <span class="paragraphbreak"></span>
              The chat records and their opinion from the post-simulation discussion are collected and organized as transcript for further analysis.
              Our participants are generally positive on our feedback and advice, and generally agreed that they reflect more deeply.
              We conclude that having emotional support is as important as having constructive advice.

              We invite seven participants and learn about their learning process and engagement while playtesting the Refles prototype.
              Participants play though the introduction and tutorial sessions of Refles and later fill in the questionnaire on their understanding of our prototype.
              <span class="paragraphbreak"></span>
              The result is mostly positive.
              The majority of our participants are willing to try using Refles in their daily routine and develop their habit of self-reflecting.
